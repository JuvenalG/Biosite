	<p class="rightP">One of Paulinaâ€™s biggest desires is to know what she desires. You may know what you your career path is, but some people take quite some time to answer this question. She does have a passion for graphic art design but is not one-hundredth percent sure about this decision. Almost a decade ago she achieved an A.A in Criminal Justice and was pretty sure this would be her career of choice. Only after receiving the degree did she decide that this was not the path she would take. Paulina knows that she is good at managing staff as she has gained experience in her current occupation as an assistant manager. Being good at something does not necessarily mean you will enjoy it. Once her life partner finishes his 4-year degree, she plans to return to college full time in pursuit of another career. As her days are numbered, she still does not know with absolute certainty what will be her academic major. She has recently found a skill for designing flyers and images on designer applications and has always wanted to start a shirt printing business. Her same passion for this type of business has led her to applying for auto wrap job positions so that she may also eventually start a business design car wraps and applying them. Let us look at her other interests and ambitions so that we may see what really drives her.  </p>

	<div class="centered">Although Paulina is still searching for her career choice, that is something that can be put on autopilot, one thing that keeps her hands on the wheel at all times is her children. When she is not playing Fortnite with her 5-year-old, she is being entertained by her 2-year-olds very advanced vocabulary. Paulina also likes playing card games with her daughters and nephews. If she is not playing Fortnite, then she is playing racing simulators. Paulina is a die-hard Oakland Raider fan (now Las Vegas). She enjoys going to games live at the stadium. When she is not visiting Oakland to watch a game, she likes to site see in San Francisco and Lake Tahoe.  </div>
